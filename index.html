Founded upon a large valley. The valley has 7 UNESCO world heritage sites. Whether you’re a history buff or not, it’s impossible not to be moved by the glorious palaces and temples around Kathmandu’s giant Durbar squares.

In this stunning wilderness, you can see the last Tibetan kingdom set in a location that seems to be lost in time and locked amidst some of the most astounding views in the Himalayas. Set in the shadow of the Annapurna and Dhaulagiri ranges. Upper Mustang is also known as Lo Manthang which translates to “Kingdom of Lo”.</div>
